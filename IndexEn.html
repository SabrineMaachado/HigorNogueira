                    Bertrand Husserl had been a precursor thinker of the philosophy of phenomenology and had a great influence on Heidegger's thought, even if he disagreed as to the direction and direction of his phenomenological investigation, since for him his analyzes had an ambiguous character, solving Heidegger's problem through of an attempt at categorical resolution and with a notion of identity that would refer to the notion of truth, resolving it from its own subject. This text explains one of the main differences between Husserl and Heidegger, regarding the phenomenological purpose that both have with their respective differences in phenomenological orientation, because although both start from the analysis of how the transcendental orientation of phenomenological investigation should be carried out, there will be differences in analysis. in the interpretative methods of their respective investigations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Husserl thinks that his transcendental problematic had no correlation whatsoever with a supposed ontological investigation, since in his view the transcendental would not find in the being of an entity, an opinion of which Heidegger will come to disagree, a stalemate that will only be solved by clarifying the way of being an entity, shifting the problem to a field of an ontological nature, with the need for an existential analysis of being by the German thinker. What is important to emphasize about the Heideggerian project in its first phase in search of the more comprehensive concept of being is the common establishment between the Cartesian metaphysical principle and its ontological project, since both affirm an inevitable existence of the condition of object as thought. Thus, through the significance of this discovery, an option is shown for a perspective more focused on the Greek bias of meaning (conception of the Aristotelian being in relation to Kantian).

                    Fredrich Nietzsche, a German philosopher who caused great influence in Heidegger's thought, exposed the processes of emptying the being due to the very negation of the negative and destructural character that life is committed to. For having God as a synthesis concept of this process, which takes on and appropriates all the normative character of man, the German philosopher goes on to the process of the so-called "overvalue of values", in order to overcome the complete nihilism that is inserted in us from Platonic thought to the respective moment, that is, murdering not only the Christian God and all the rational metaphysical ideas around him. Only in this way, in Nietzsche's view, would there be a leap towards absolute denial for the then affirmation of life in its fullness, '' Dionysian of risk, violent and combative ''.

                    Heidegger demonstrates to us through thinkers since the ancients how the history of philosophy has always followed a path based on the entification of the being, sometimes with notions of displacement of the truth, passing through the medieval ones with formulations of the divine being as later on by the term subject-being, fundamentalized and culminating in the emptying and total forgetfulness of being, displacing the notion of truth as an entity. What is important to emphasize about the Heideggerian project in its first phase is the common establishment between the Cartesian metaphysical principle and its ontological project, since both affirm an inevitable existence of the condition of object as thought. For the German thinker who studied Nietzsche thought, Wolfgang Muller-Lauter, one must recognize in history a kind of path that will inevitably lead to nihilism, that is, an increasingly worsening of the disease of meaninglessness that life imposes. Thus in Lautter's words: '' effectively what is seen in Nietzsche's philosophy is that of the multiplicity of wills of power, which concerns interrelated antagonisms, forming the world in such a relationship '' (Wolfgang Muller-lautter pg. 68 2005).

                    Right through the thought of this second Heidegger, it is necessary to think through a new perspective with a broader key, because in his new view man must free himself from the shackles of grammar, that is, from this technical thinking because for metaphysics to be overcome, language must necessarily be rethought first, since every humanism on which language is also founded is guided by metaphysics. All humanism is based on metaphysics and the attempt to interpret man without knowing the truth of being is already a metaphysics, therefore all metaphysics is humanistic although Heidegger stresses that first it is necessary to study metaphysics in all its essence and plenitude, in order to that one can understand all the real significance of being. For Heidegger, science cannot do without metaphysics. One has to think of a less technical language as a way out. For Heidegger, the man who does not know the truth of being is already part of the wrong way for an interpretation of a metaphysical key, due to wanting to give conditions to something for which he does not have the capacity to analyze being. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For metaphysics will always have the capacity to attract the being, culminating in its forgetfulness unless the individual starts a new analysis about forgetting in a different way than what has already been approached. For a Dasein that, instead of leaving an external point, panoramic towards the other, starts to be next to this one, next to this being that is revealed behind this object that manifests itself as anguish, because it absorbs the logics of languages and languages. speeches makes the words reach a full concept of truth, as adequacy of conceptual judgments with the given situation. If the truth itself realizes the lack of reasoning of itself, it begins to demand a new criterion of validity for itself, with a notion of language committed to the true essence originating from truth and openness.

                    Em suma, percebe-se o trajeto intentado por Heidegger em alcançar o conceito pleno de ser, partindo de sua análise existenciária presente em Ser e tempo e posteriormente para a noção de clareira, como método buscado em função de seu abandono pelo caminho antes traçado, partindo para o estudo interpretativo das línguas especialmente da linguagem poética e suas vertentes. O que procuramos objetivar no decorrer da exposição de cada capítulo, dentre outros aspectos, é a maneira singular com que Heidegger desenvolve a sua filosofia, utilizando-se de um exame criterioso da língua a fim de buscar na sua própria fonte o verdadeiro sentido daquilo que fora deturpado pela vigência da lógica no contexto do pensamento ocidental. Este exercício filológico impulsionado pelo filósofo nos permite perceber que é na voz dos gregos, em sua mais recôndita expressão, que se encontra o vigor do pensar e a sua dimensão poética que este tanto buscou alcançar.
